.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
A physics model for our rigid hand made out of various \fBUnity\fP Collider\&.

.PP 
.SS "override void Leap\&.Unity\&.RigidHand\&.InitHand ()\fC [virtual]\fP"
Implement this function to initialise this hand after it is created\&. This function is called by the HandController during the \fBUnity\fP Update() phase when a new hand is detected by the \fBLeap\fP Motion device\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBLeap\&.Unity\&.HandModel\fP\&.
.PP
Definition at line 28 of file RigidHand\&.cs\&.
.SS "override bool Leap\&.Unity\&.RigidHand\&.SupportsEditorPersistence ()\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Returns whether or not this hand model supports editor persistence\&. This is false by default and must be opt-in by a developer making their own hand model script if they want editor persistence\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBLeap\&.Unity\&.HandModelBase\fP\&.
.PP
Definition at line 24 of file RigidHand\&.cs\&.
.SS "override void Leap\&.Unity\&.RigidHand\&.UpdateHand ()\fC [virtual]\fP"
Implement this function to update this hand once every game loop\&. For \fBHandModel\fP instances assigned to the HandController graphics hand list, the HandController calls this function during the \fBUnity\fP Update() phase\&. For \fBHandModel\fP instances in the physics hand list, the HandController calls this function in the FixedUpdate() phase\&. 
.PP
Implements \fBLeap\&.Unity\&.HandModel\fP\&.
