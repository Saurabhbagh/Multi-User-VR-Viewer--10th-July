.SH NAME
Leap.Unity.IValueProxy \- A simple interface that allows an object to act as a 'proxy' interface to another object\&. The proxy can store a serialized representation of a value on another object\&. The value of the proxy can either be updated from the object (pull), or be pushed out to the object (push)\&.

.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
A simple interface that allows an object to act as a 'proxy' interface to another object\&. The proxy can store a serialized representation of a value on another object\&. The value of the proxy can either be updated from the object (pull), or be pushed out to the object (push)\&. 

This interface is normally used in animation systems where something that needs to be animated does not have an easily animatable representation\&. The proxy stands in as the animatable representation, while still allowing normal reads and writes\&.
