.PP 
Causes any Colliders located on the same GameObject to be ignored by the Interaction Engine\&. Does not affect parents or children\&. It is recommended that you use this component only with trigger colliders\&. 

Colliders are still be visible to PhysX, so they can be used, for example, for collision against scene geometry, or for raycasting\&. However, the Interaction Engine will not allow Interaction Objects to be grasped or hovered by checks between hands and this collider, and soft-contact forces will not be applied on this collider\&.
.PP
There is one important caveat: If the colliders are NOT triggers, they may still experience depenetration forces from PhysX against hand or controller colliders while those colliders are not in soft-contact mode (which activates when hands or colliders intersect objects beyond a certain depth)\&. This inconsistency is immaterial when the ignored collider is a trigger\&.
