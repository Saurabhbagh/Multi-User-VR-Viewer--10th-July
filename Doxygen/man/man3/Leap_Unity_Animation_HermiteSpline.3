.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Represents a spline that travels from one point in space to another over a specified time frame\&. The two endpoints are specified, as well as the instantaneous velocity at these two endpoints\&. 

You may ask for the position or the velocity at any time during the splines duration\&.
