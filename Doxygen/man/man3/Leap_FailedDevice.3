.PP 
The \fBFailedDevice\fP class provides information about \fBLeap\fP Motion hardware that has been physically connected to the client computer, but is not operating correctly\&. 

Failed devices do not provide any tracking data and do not show up in the \fBController\&.Devices()\fP list\&.
.PP
Get the list of failed devices using \fBController\&.FailedDevices()\fP\&.
