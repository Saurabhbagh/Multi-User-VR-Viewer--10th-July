.SH NAME
Leap.Unity.Interaction.KinematicGraspedMovement \- This implementation of \fBIGraspedMovementHandler\fP moves its interaction object to a target position and rotation by setting its rigidbody position and rotation directly to that target position and rotation\&. This is required when working with kinematic rigidbodies, which do not move based on their velocity and angular velocity\&.
