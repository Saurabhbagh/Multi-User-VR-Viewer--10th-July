This User Guide was designed to provide first time users of TextMesh Pro with a basic overview of the features and functionality of the tool\&.
.PP
.SS "**Installation**"
.PP
The TextMesh Pro UPM package is already included with the Unity Editor and as such does not require installation\&. TextMesh Pro 'TMP' does however require adding resources to your project which are essential for using TextMesh Pro\&.
.PP
To import the '*TMP Essential Resources*', please use the '*Window -> TextMeshPro -> Import TMP Essential Resources*' menu option\&. These resources will be added at the root of your project in the '*TextMesh Pro*' folder\&.
.PP
The TextMesh Pro package also includes additional resources and examples that will make discovering and learning about TextMesh Pro's powerful features easier\&. It is strongly recommended that first time users import these additional resources\&.
.PP
To import the '*TMP Examples & Extras*', please use the '*Window -> TextMeshPro -> Import TMP Examples & Extras*' menu option\&. These resources will also be added in the same '*TextMesh Pro*' folder inside your project\&.
.PP
.SS "**Quick Start**"

There are two TextMesh Pro components available\&. The first TMP text component is of type <TextMeshPro> and designed to work with the MeshRenderer\&. This component is an ideal replacement for the legacy TextMesh component\&.

.PP
The second TMP text component is of type <TextMeshProUGUI> and designed to work with the CanvasRenderer and Canvas system\&. This component is an ideal replacement for the UI\&.Text component\&.

To add a new <TextMeshProUGUI> text object, go to: “*GameObject->UI->TextMeshPro Text*”\&.
