.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The \fBBone\fP class represents a tracked bone\&. 

All fingers contain 4 bones that make up the anatomy of the finger\&. Get valid \fBBone\fP objects from a \fBFinger\fP object\&.
.PP
Bones are ordered from base to tip, indexed from 0 to 3\&. Additionally, the bone's Type enum may be used to index a specific bone anatomically\&.
.PP
The thumb does not have a base metacarpal bone and therefore contains a valid, zero length bone at that location\&.

.PP
The orthonormal basis vectors for this \fBBone\fP as a \fBMatrix\fP\&. The orientation of this \fBBone\fP as a Quaternion\&. Basis vectors specify the orientation of a bone\&.
.PP
\fBxBasis\fP Perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the bone; exits the sides of the finger\&.
.PP
\fByBasis or up vector\fP Perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the bone; exits the top and bottom of the finger\&. More positive in the upward direction\&.
.PP
\fBzBasis\fP Aligned with the longitudinal axis of the bone\&. More positive toward the base of the finger\&.
.PP
The bases provided for the right hand use the right-hand rule; those for the left hand use the left-hand rule\&. Thus, the positive direction of the x-basis is to the right for the right hand and to the left for the left hand\&. You can change from right-hand to left-hand rule by multiplying the z basis vector by -1\&.
.PP
You can use the basis vectors for such purposes as measuring complex finger poses and skeletal animation\&.
.PP
Note that converting the basis vectors directly into a quaternion representation is not mathematically valid\&. If you use quaternions, create them from the derived rotation matrix not directly from the bases\&.
