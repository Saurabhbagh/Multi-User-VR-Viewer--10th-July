* Estimated: Body part location canâ€™t be directly determined by the device\&. Any skeletal pose provided by the device is estimated based on the active buttons, triggers, joysticks, or other input sensors\&. Examples include the Vive Controller and gamepads\&.

* Partial: Body part location can be measured directly but with fewer degrees of freedom than the actual body part\&.Certain body part positions may be unmeasured by the device and estimated from other input data\&.Examples include Knuckles or gloves that only measure finger curl
