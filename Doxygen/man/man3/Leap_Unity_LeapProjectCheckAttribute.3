.SH NAME
Leap.Unity.LeapProjectCheckAttribute \- Add this attribute to a settings check\&. This method will be called often while the \fBLeap\fP Motion \fBUnity\fP Window is open, so it should be as light-weight as possible!

.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Add this attribute to a settings check\&. This method will be called often while the \fBLeap\fP Motion \fBUnity\fP Window is open, so it should be as light-weight as possible! If you need to do a heavy check that involves scanning the current scene for example, you should gate the check behind a button\&. 

This project check is called during OnGUI in a Vertical layout context, so you should draw a box containing any messages, buttons, results, warnings, auto-fixes, and ignores suitable for the check\&.
.PP
For 'ignore' functionality, use LeapProjectChecks\&.CheckIgnoreKey(string) and LeapProjectsChecks\&.SetIgnoreKey(string) so that ignore actions can be remembered and cleared by the project checks GUI\&.
