.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The \fBHand\fP class reports the physical characteristics of a detected hand\&. 

\fBHand\fP tracking data includes a palm position and velocity; vectors for the palm normal and direction to the fingers; and lists of the attached fingers\&.
.PP
Note that \fBHand\fP objects can be invalid, which means that they do not contain valid tracking data and do not correspond to a physical entity\&. Invalid \fBHand\fP objects can be the result of using the default constructor, or modifying the hand data in an incorrect way\&.

.PP
Note that ID values persist across frames, but only until tracking of a particular object is lost\&. If tracking of a hand is lost and subsequently regained, the new \fBFinger\fP object representing that finger may have a different ID than that representing the finger in an earlier frame\&.
