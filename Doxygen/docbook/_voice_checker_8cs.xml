<para>Voice Check works in a walky talky manner. You press the grip button and it will transfer your voice to other player / clients in the network. You will not be able hear your own voice. Here you convert the voice to float and then to byte to send it on the network. Once the other non local player who receives it will do the reverse of it . There it will get converted from byte to float and then to Audio Clip </para>
