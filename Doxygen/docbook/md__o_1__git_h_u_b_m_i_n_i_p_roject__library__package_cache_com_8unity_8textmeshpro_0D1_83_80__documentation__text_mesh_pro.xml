<para>The TextMesh Pro UPM package is already included with the Unity Editor and as such does not require installation. TextMesh Pro &quot;TMP&quot; does however require adding resources to your project which are essential for using TextMesh Pro.</para>

<para>To import the &quot;*TMP Essential Resources*&quot;, please use the &quot;*Window -&gt; TextMeshPro -&gt; Import TMP Essential Resources*&quot; menu option. These resources will be added at the root of your project in the &quot;*TextMesh Pro*&quot; folder.</para>

<para>The TextMesh Pro package also includes additional resources and examples that will make discovering and learning about TextMesh Pro&apos;s powerful features easier. It is strongly recommended that first time users import these additional resources.</para>

<para>To import the &quot;*TMP Examples &amp; Extras*&quot;, please use the &quot;*Window -&gt; TextMeshPro -&gt; Import TMP Examples &amp; Extras*&quot; menu option. These resources will also be added in the same &quot;*TextMesh Pro*&quot; folder inside your project.</para>
