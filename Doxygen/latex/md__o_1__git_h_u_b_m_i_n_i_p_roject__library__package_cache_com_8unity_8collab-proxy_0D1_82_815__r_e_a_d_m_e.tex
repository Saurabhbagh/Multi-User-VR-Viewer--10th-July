This is the packaged version of Collab, currently limited to containing the History and Toolbar windows, along with supporting classes.

\subsection*{Development}

Check this repository out in your \{\$\+P\+R\+O\+J\+E\+CT\}/\+Packages/ folder, under the name com.\+unity.\+collab-\/proxy. The classes will be built by Unity.

\subsection*{Testing}

In order to run the tests, you will need to add this project to the testables key in your manifest.\+json -\/ once you have done this, the tests will be picked up by the Unity Test Runner window.

\subsection*{Building}

You may build this project using msbuild. The commands to do so can be seen under .gitlab-\/ci.\+yml.

\subsection*{Deploying}

Gitlab will automatically build your project when you deploy. You can download the resulting artifact, which will be a dll, and place it in your Editor/bin/ folder. Open the package in Unity to generate the meta files, and then you will be able to publish.

We\textquotesingle{}re currently looking into a way to avoid this manual process.
